## Challenges Faced

This project was a very enlightening experience. I got to learn a lot during this period from Templating with EJS to saving data in a databse. This was a great experience for learning both front-end and back-end. 

As well as storing private data in environment variables and deploying with a database. Overall I had a great experience building this!
